# Multigrid

Matlab framework to compute projected descent multigrid method. Experiments optimizing the residues of the Eikonal equation for fire arrival time in a coupled atmosphere-fire data (from WRF-SFIRE).

# Tests

To test the functions:
1) Start Matlab inside Multigrid folder, so inside Multigrid folder type in terminal

      \$ matlab -nodesktop -nodisplay

2) If you started Matlab in another folder, run inside Matlab 

      \>\> startup

3) Run any of the tests in the tests folder. For example:

      \>\> cd tests

      \>\> pdirichlet_constr_test
